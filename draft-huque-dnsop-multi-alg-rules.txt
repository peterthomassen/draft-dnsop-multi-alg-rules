                   Multiple Algorithm Rules in DNSSEC
                  draft-huque-dnsop-multi-alg-rules-00

Abstract

   This document proposes to address some limitations in the DNS
   protocol that pose challenges for DNSSEC configurations that
   advertise multiple Secure Entry Points (SEP) with different signing
   algorithms via their DS record or trust anchor set.  Solutions to
   these limitations will allow for both multi-signer operation and for
   the transfer of signed DNS zones between providers, where the
   providers support disjoint DNSSEC algorithm sets.  In addition, the
   proposal enables pre-publication of a trust anchor in preparation for
   an algorithm rollover, such as of the root zone.

1.  Introduction and Motivation

   RFC EDITOR: PLEASE REMOVE THE FOLLOWING PARAGRAPH BEFORE PUBLISHING:
   The source for this draft is maintained in GitHub at:
   https://github.com/shuque/draft-dnsop-multi-alg-rules

   The Domain Name System Security Extensions (DNSSEC) [RFC4033]
   [RFC4034] [RFC4035] add data origin authentication and integrity
   protection to the Domain Name System (DNS), by having DNS zone owners
   (or their operators) crytographically sign their zone data.

   The Multi-Signer Extensions [RFC8901] describe how multiple providers
   using distinct DNSSEC keys can co-operatively serve the same DNS
   zone.  DNSSEC Automation [DNSSEC-AUTO] further describes how to fully
   automate Multi-Signer operations, as well as how to use a
   transitional state of a multi-signer configuration to non-
   disruptively transfer a signed zone from one provider to another.
   These methods do not work however if the providers involved employ
   different DNSSEC algorithms, due to restrictions imposed by the
   current protocol specifications.  This is not just a theoretical
   problem.  Real situations in the field have occurred where this has
   posed an obstacle to DNSSEC deployment and operations.

   The same restrictions limit flexiblity during algorithm rollovers for
   zones with trust anchors.  To ensure that a validation is available,
   the old key and associated signatures cannot be removed until
   virtually all validating resolvers have updated their trust anchor
   (TA).  In order to allow resolver operators to perform this update,
   the new trust anchor has to be published ahead of time.

   Current specifications [RFC6840] imply that when a trust anchor for a
   new algorithm is published, the associated DNSKEY and RRSIGs already
   need to be in place.  When rolling the algorithm for the root zone,
   this could lead to a potentialy very long phase of double-signing the
   zone, on the order of a year.  To reduce potential risks from
   unintended side effects (such as from overly large packets) during
   such a rollover, it seems desirable to create a way publishing the
   new trust anchor without introducing the new algorithm into the zone
   yet.

2.  Current Multiple Algorithm Rules

   Section 2.2 (last paragraph) of [RFC4035] states the following:

   "There MUST be an RRSIG for each RRset using at least one DNSKEY of
   each algorithm in the zone apex DNSKEY RRset.  The apex DNSKEY RRset
   itself MUST be signed by each algorithm appearing in the DS RRset
   located at the delegating parent (if any)."

   Further, Section 5.11 of [RFC6840] clarifies:

   "A signed zone MUST include a DNSKEY for each algorithm present in
   the zone's DS RRset and expected trust anchors for the zone."

   This rule is impractical to satisfy if DNS providers deployed in a
   multi-signer configuration are using different signing algorithms.
   By extension, it also means that multi-signer techniques cannot be
   employed to non-disruptively transfer a signed zone from one DNS
   provider to another if the providers use differing algorithms.

   The rule further collides with the conflicting goal of pre-publishing
   the new trust anchor during a zone's algorithm rollover, while
   introducing the new algorithm into the zone only later in the
   process.

   Furthermore, for online signers attempting to deploy multiple
   algorithms, this rule also imposes a significant computational
   burden, unless a selective algorithm negotiation mechanism is also
   developed.

   Although unstated in that document, the original rationale for this
   rule was algorithm downgrade protection.  An attacker cannot
   undetectably strip away signatures by a stronger algorithm from
   signed DNS responses.  Section 5.11 of DNSSEC Clarifications
   [RFC6840], referring to the above rule, thus states that:

   "This requirement applies to servers, not validators.  Validators
   SHOULD accept any single valid path.  They SHOULD NOT insist that all
   algorithms signaled in the DS RRset work, and they MUST NOT insist
   that all algorithms signaled in the DNSKEY RRset work."

   Effectively, this means that any validator following this rule does
   not provide algorithm downgrade protection, rendering the requirement
   in RFC 4035 somewhat meaningless.  The two quoted assertions in RFC
   4035 and 6840 are thus arguably contradictory.

3.  Support for a wide range of validators

   A secondary reason for the rule in RFC 4035 is that it allows signed
   data in the zone to be authenticatable by a wide range of validating
   resolvers that may support different algorithms.  This is sound
   advice as a general rule, and allows a zone operator to introduce a
   newish algorithm that does not yet have wide support in the field by
   double signing it with a well known algorithm.  But the rule is too
   rigid to support other reasonable configurations where differing
   algorithms may be in use, but all of which are very widely supported.
   Multi-signer and inter-provider transfers involving differing but
   only well known algorithms are cases in point.

4.  Does DNSSEC need algorithm downgrade protection?

   All things being equal, algorithm downgrade protection would be a
   desirable property.  But in general, only the zone owner knows the
   intent of their use of multiple algorithms.  For example, if a zone
   owner wants to deploy a multi-signer configuration across two
   providers supporting the algorithms ECDSAP256SHA256 and
   RSASHA256-3072-bit respectively, it should be possible to do so
   without unnecessary protocol impediments.  Those algorithms are
   roughly comparable in strength and there is no threat of downgrade
   attack.

   More generally, a zone owner can avoid the threat of algorithm
   downgrade by simply choosing to use only a set of sufficiently strong
   algorithms.  Validators should not unilaterally impose requirements
   that interfere with the zone owner's actual intentions.  In fact, the
   clarifying behavior of validators in RFC6840 which states that they
   should accept "any" valid authentication path is compatible with this
   stance.

   The emerging threat of quantum computers may offer a more compelling
   rationale for algorithm downgrade protection.  A zone owner could
   double sign their zone with a classical as well as a post-quantum
   algorithm, and want to make sure a future break of the classical
   algorithm does not allow attackers to strip away the post quantum

   signatures.  A secure signaling mechanism that permits a zone owner
   to advertise their intention in this regard would be useful.  Note
   that presently no post quantum signature algorithms for DNSSEC have
   been standardized.

5.  Proposed Updates to RFCs

   Initial proposal: relax the quoted rule in RFC 4035.  Change the MUST
   to a SHOULD, and state that there are valid configurations where this
   rule could be disregarded.

   Longer term: develop a scheme to allow a zone owner to securely
   signal their desire for algorithm downgrade protection.  One possible
   method to do this is a "DS hack": namely overloading the signed DS
   record set in the parent zone to convey this signal, a technique that
   has been met with some resistance by protocol purists in the past.
   Another method would be to define a new resource record type for this
   purpose.  Special consideration would have to given to where such a
   signal would be placed for the root zone if needed (or whether the
   root zone should just have a hardcoded rule).  Details of such a
   proposal are deferred to a future document (or a revision of this
   one).  If and when such a proposal is developed, the text in RFC
   6840, Section 5.11 will need to be updated to enforce algorithm
   downgrade protection in the presence of the signal.

6.  IANA Considerations

   Initially none.  If a later scheme for algorithm downgrade signaling
   is developed, new protocol parameter numbers will be needed for DS or
   a new resource record type.

7.  Security Considerations

   TBD.
