Abstract

   This document proposes to address some inconsistencies and
   limitations in the DNS protocol that pose challenges for
   configurations of multi-signer operation and for the transfer of
   signed DNS zones between providers, where the providers support
   disjoint DNSSEC algorithm sets.

1.  Introduction and Motivation

   RFC EDITOR: PLEASE REMOVE THE FOLLOWING PARAGRAPH BEFORE PUBLISHING:
   The source for this draft is maintained in GitHub at:
   https://github.com/shuque/draft-dnsop-multi-alg-rules

   The Domain Name System Security Extensions (DNSSEC) [RFC4033]
   [RFC4034] [RFC4035] add data origin authentication and integrity
   protection to the Domain Name System (DNS), by having DNS zone owners
   (or their operators) crytographically sign their zone data.

   The Multi-Signer Extensions [RFC8901] describe how multiple providers
   using distinct DNSSEC keys can co-operatively serve the same DNS
   zone.  DNSSEC Automation [DNSSEC-AUTO] further describes how to fully
   automate Multi-Signer operations, as well as how to use Model-2 of
   the Multi-Signer models to non-disruptively transfer a signed zone
   from one provider to another.  These methods do not work however if
   the providers involved employ different DNSSEC algorithms, due to
   restrictions imposed by the current protocol specifications.  This is
   not just a theoretical problem.  Real examples in the field have
   occurred where this has posed an obstacle to DNSSEC deployment.

2.  Current Multiple Algorithm Rules

   Section 2.2 (last paragraph) of [RFC4035] states the following:

   "There MUST be an RRSIG for each RRset using at least one DNSKEY of
   each algorithm in the zone apex DNSKEY RRset.  The apex DNSKEY RRset
   itself MUST be signed by each algorithm appearing in the DS RRset
   located at the delegating parent (if any)."

   Although unstated in that document, the original rationale for this
   rule was algorithm downgrade protection.  An attacker cannot
   undetectably strip away signatures by a weaker algorithm from signed
   DNS responses.

   This rule cannot be satisfied if DNS providers deployed in a multi-
   signer configuration are using different signing algorithms.  By
   extension, it also means that multi-signer techniques cannot be
   employed to non-disruptively transfer a signed zone from one DNS
   provider to another if the providers use differing algorithms.

   For online signers attempting to deploy multiple algorithms, this
   rule also imposes a significant computational burden, unless a
   selective algorithm negotiation mechanism is also developed.

   On the other hand, Section 5.11 of DNSSEC Clarifications [RFC6840]
   referring to the above rule states that:

   "This requirement applies to servers, not validators.  Validators
   SHOULD accept any single valid path.  They SHOULD NOT insist that all
   algorithms signaled in the DS RRset work, and they MUST NOT insist
   that all algorithms signaled in the DNSKEY RRset work."

   Effectively, this means that any validator following this rule does
   not provide algorithm downgrade protection, rendering the requirement
   in RFC 4035 somewhat meaningless.  The two quoted assertions in RFC
   4035 and 6840 are thus arguably contradictory.

3.  Does DNSSEC need algorithm downgrade protection?

   All things being equal, algorithm downgrade protection would be a
   desirable property.  But in general, only the zone owner knows the
   intent of their use of multiple algorithms.  For example, if a zone
   owner wants to deploy a multi-signer configuration across two
   providers supporting the algorithms ECDSAP256SHA256 and
   RSASHA256-3072-bit respectively, it should be possible to do so
   without unnecessary protocol impediments.  Those algorithms are
   roughly equivalent in strength and there is no threat of downgrade
   attack.

   More generally, a zone owner can avoid the threat of algorithm
   downgrade by simply choosing to use a set of sufficiently strong
   algorithms.  Validators should not unilaterally impose requirements
   that interfere with the zone owner's actual intentions.  In fact, the
   clarifying behavior of validators stated in RFC6840 which states that
   they should accept "any" valid authenticatable path is consistent
   with this stance.

   The emerging threat of quantum computers may offer a more compelling
   rationale for algorithm downgrade protection.  A zone owner could
   double sign their zone with a classical as well as a post-quantum
   algorithm, and want to make sure a future break of the classical
   algorithm does not allow attackers to strip away the post quantum

   signatures.  A secure signaling mechanism that permits a zone owner
   to advertise their intention in this regard would be useful.  Note
   that presently no post quantum signature algorithms for DNSSEC have
   been standardized.

4.  Proposed Updates to RFCs

   Initial proposal: remove the quoted rule in RFC 4035.

   Longer term: develop a scheme to allow a zone owner to securely
   signal their desire for algorithm downgrade protection.  One possible
   method to do this is a "DS hack": namely overloading the signed DS
   record set in the parent zone to convey this signal, a technique that
   has been met with some resistance by protocol purists in the past.
   Another method would be to define a new resource record type for this
   purpose.  Special consideration would have to given to where such a
   signal would be placed for the root zone if needed.  Details of such
   a proposal are deferred to a future document (or a revision of this
   one).

5.  IANA Considerations

   Initially none.  If a later scheme for algorithm downgrade signaling
   is developed, new protocol parameter numbers will be needed for DS or
   a new resource record type.

6.  Security Considerations

   TBD.

7.  Acknowledgements
